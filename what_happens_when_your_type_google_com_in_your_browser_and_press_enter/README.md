## 🚀 The Journey: Step by Step

When you type `https://www.google.com` and press Enter, here's what happens:

1. **🌐 DNS Resolution** - Your browser asks "What's Google's IP address?"
2. **🔗 Connection** - Browser connects to that IP on port 443 (HTTPS)
3. **🔒 Encryption** - Secure HTTPS connection established with TLS/SSL
4. **🛡️ Security** - Request passes through Google's firewalls
5. **⚖️ Distribution** - Load balancer picks the best server to handle your request
6. **🌐 Processing** - Web server receives and processes the request
7. **💻 Application** - Application server generates the Google homepage
8. **🗃️ Data** - Database provides search algorithms and personalization data
9. **📦 Response** - Complete Google homepage sent back to your browser
10. **🎉 Display** - You see the familiar Google search interface

## 🔧 How to Use These Files

### Generate Diagram Image:
```bash
# Using Mermaid CLI
npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i diagram.mmd -o my-diagram.png

# Or use online editor at https://mermaid.live/
```

### View the Diagram:
```bash
# Open the generated PNG
open diagram.png
```
